# When it is time to rebuild an RPM to address CVEs or explain to ProdSec what we need it for, it is not always obvious what 
# the RPM is for if no image is using it, or if the image is actually using a different version or some other special 
# situation.
# this is to document known RPM motivations (requests we received or asked about)
# the names listed are brew package names
